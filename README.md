Fake News Detector AI
This repository contains code for a Fake News Detector AI, designed to classify news articles as either real or fake using artificial intelligence techniques.

Introduction
Fake news has become a significant concern in recent times due to its potential to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning models to automatically identify fake news articles.

Features
Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.
Implements a BERT-based model for text classification.
Provides functionalities for preprocessing textual data, including tokenization and embedding generation.
Includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction.
Offers scripts for model training, testing, and inference.
